      /* 
  Debouncing helps limit the rate at which a function is called, which can significantly improve overall app performance.

  How it works:
  When an event is triggered repeatedly—such as typing in an input field—the associated function is typically called on every event (e.g., every keystroke). This can lead to performance issues.

  Debouncing solves this by ensuring the function is only executed if timegap between two keystroke event is grater then the specified delay like 500 or 300ms

  Example:
  Imagine a search bar that calls a `search()` function on every keystroke. Without debouncing, it would call the API on each key press, which is inefficient.

  With debouncing, the `search()` function is only called when the user stops typing for at least 500 milliseconds, reducing unnecessary calls and improving efficiency.

      const input = document.querySelector("#searchInput");
      const output = document.querySelector("#debouncedOutput");

      const search = (query) => {
        console.log(`Searching for ${query}`);
        output.textContent = query;
      };

      const debounce = (func, delay) => {
        let timer;
        return function (...args) {
          clearTimeout(timer);
          timer = setTimeout(() => {
            func.call(this, args);
          }, delay);
        };
      };

      const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 500);

      input.addEventListener("keyup", (e) => {
        debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
      });
