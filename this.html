        /* What is the value of this inside a function 
           This is little different
           Suppose we are in strict mode then the value of this is undefined
           Sippose we are in non strict mode then the value of this is window
           Why?
           Because of this substitution
           It states that if the value of this undefined or null then js put window object to the this only in non strict mode but not in strict mode for this we get different value of this in function in strict and non strict mode

        /* Value of this inside a method : Method means the function inside an object 
           Inside a method this refers to the object from where the function belongs to like sayHello method belongs to the user object so that this inside the sayHello method points the user object and when we try to print this.userName it shows Alex

           Arrow function doesn't have it's own this value so it always inherit the value of this from it's lexical enviroment.
        */

        /* In the below example stuDetails1 is an arrow function so whenever we want to access the value of this.name or this.rollNo it's gives us undefined because we know that arrow function don't have it's own this it inherit the value of this from it's lexical scope so stuDetails1 lexical scope is global scope and there is nothing like name and rollNo so it gives us undefined
        But in the case of stuDetails2 this is not a arrow function it is normal function but inside the function i use a arrow function so now this arrow function again inherit the value of this from it's laxical scope now it's laxical scope is stuDetails2 method and for this method value of this is the student object for this value of this inside the arrow function become the student object for that we can access name and rollNo.

        /* What is the console value inside the function 
           It will different
           Now this print undefined because userName is declared with let means if we create any variable using let and const it's not a part of global object (window for browser) and the value of this inside the function is global object means window (for non strict mode) and inside the gobal object there is nothing name as userName so that it gives us undefined
           But if we create the name varibale using var or without any keyWord then it becomes a part of the global object so that inside the function we can access them using this.userName
