    <h1>Concept of throttle</h1>

    <script>

        /* 
        Throttling is used to limit how frequently a function is called, especially when that function is triggered by high-frequency events like `resize`, `scroll`, or `mousemove`.

         Without throttling:
         The function will be called on every single event, which can be inefficient and cause performance issues.

         With throttling:
         Throttling ensures that the function is only called once per specified time interval, no matter how many events occur during that time.

         Example:
         Suppose we have a function that performs an expensive operation on window resize.
         Without throttling, it would execute on every small change in window size.
         With throttling (e.g., a 500ms interval), the function will only be called at most once every 500ms, improving performance.

        const expensiveCall = (currentWidth)=>{
            console.log(`Make the call when width is ${currentWidth}`)
        }

        const throttle = (fun,limit)=>{
            let flag = true
            return function(...args){
                if(flag){
                    fun.apply(this,args)
                    flag = false
                    setTimeout(()=>{
                        flag = true
                    },limit)
                }
            }
        }

        const throttleExpensiveCall = throttle(expensiveCall,500)

        window.addEventListener('resize',(e)=>{
            throttleExpensiveCall(e.target.innerWidth)
        })
